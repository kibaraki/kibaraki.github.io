abstract = {Previous research has revealed that Japanese tits (Parus minor) use synthetic syntax to combine various elements of their vocalizations and derive complex meanings. We collect and annotate a new dataset of vocalizations produced by the Parus minor bird and develop a full taxonomy of individual phonemes for this species, a total of 91 phonemes of different granularities. We provide an in-depth overview of the phonemes and explore methods to classify them automatically. Our best performing few-shot model achieves 13.9\% multilabel accuracy on the test data.},
