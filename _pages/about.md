#### About
I'm Katsumi Ibaraki, a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame, advised by Dr. David Chiang in the [Natural Language Processing Group](https://nlp.nd.edu/). My research interest lies in the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing. In particular, I am interested in multilingual NLP, multimodal NLP, and language learning/acquisition.

Outside of research, I enjoy kendo and teaching at a language school.
